# 4.2 - 4.4 Homework
Use comparison operators, logicial operators, and/or random numbers to solve each question.

## QUESTION #1:
Write a program that generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 and then outputs both numbers and whether the first number is a 2 <ins>**and**</ins> the second number is a 4. 

### <ins>Sample Outputs:</ins>
```
The first random number is: 1
The second random number is: 4

Is the first number a 2 and the second a 4? False
```
```
The first random number is: 4
The second random number is: 2

Is the first number a 2 and the second a 4? False
```
```
The first random number is: 2
The second random number is: 4

Is the first number a 2 and the second a 4? True
```

## QUESTION #2:
Write a program that generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 and then outputs both numbers and whether the first number is less than 3 <ins>**and**</ins> the second number is greater than three.

### <ins>Sample Outputs:</ins>
```
The first random number is: 1
The second random number is: 4

Is the first number less than 3 and the second greater than 3? True
```
```
The first random number is: 4
The second random number is: 6

Is the first number less than 3 and the second greater than 3? False
```
```
The first random number is: 3
The second random number is: 4

Is the first number less than 3 and the second greater than 3? False
```

## QUESTION #3:
Write a program that generates three random numbers between 1 and 6 and then outputs the three numbers and whether the second is between the first <ins>**and**</ins> the third.

### <ins>Sample Outputs:</ins>
```
The first random number is: 1
The second random number is: 4
The third random number is: 5

Is the second number between the first and third number? True
```
```
The first random number is: 4
The second random number is: 4
The third random number is: 6

Is the second number between the first and third number? False
```
```
The first random number is: 4
The second random number is: 2
The third random number is: 6

Is the second number between the first and third number? False
```

## QUESTION #4:
Write a program that generates two random numbers between 1 and 50 and then prompts the user to guess what the two numbers are. Output a message that states whether the user guessed both numbers correctly (Order matters).

### <ins>Sample Outputs:</ins>
>Assume random numbers generated are 10 then 42
```
Guess the first number: 10
Guess the second number: 42

Was your guess correct? True
```
>Assume random numbers generated are 10 then 42
```
Guess the first number: 42
Guess the second number: 10

Was your guess correct? False
```
>Assume random numbers generated are 10 then 42
```
Guess the first number: 2
Guess the second number: 42

Was your guess correct? False
```

## QUESTION #5:
Write a program that generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 and then outputs both numbers and whether the first number is less than or equal to 3 <ins>**or**</ins> the second number is greater than 3.

### <ins>Sample Outputs:</ins>
```
The first random number is: 1
The second random number is: 4

Is the first number less than or equal to 3 or the second greater than 3? True
```
```
The first random number is: 3
The second random number is: 2

Is the first number less than or equal to 3 or the second greater than 3? True
```
```
The first random number is: 6
The second random number is: 2

Is the first number less than or equal to 3 or the second greater than 3? False
```

## QUESTION #6:
Write a program that generates two random numbers between 50 and 100 and then prompts the user to guess what the two numbers are. Output a message that states whether the user guessed either of the numbers correctly. (Order does not matter)

### <ins>Sample Outputs:</ins>
>Assume random numbers generated are 62 and 83
```
Guess the first number: 62
Guess the second number: 83

Was your guess correct? True
```
>Assume random numbers generated are 62 and 83
```
Guess the first number: 62
Guess the second number: 83

Was your guess correct? True
```
>Assume random numbers generated are 62 and 83
```
Guess the first number: 62
Guess the second number: 90

Was your guess correct? False
```

## QUESTION #7:
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and then outputs the number and whether the number is even. (HINT: Use modulus)

### <ins>Sample Outputs:</ins>
```
The random number is: 42
Is the number even? True
```
```
The random number is: 59
Is the number even? False
```

## QUESTION #8:
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and then outputs the number and whether the number is odd. (HINT: Use modulus)

### <ins>Sample Outputs:</ins>
```
The random number is: 42
Is the number odd? False
```
```
The random number is: 59
Is the number odd? True
```
